Honorbuddy Meshes Repository

Thank you for downloading the honorbuddy meshfiles from our repository. Here, we are going to explain, how to use them.

Details

Using the downloaded meshfiles is easy as 1-2-3. Here you go:
1.In your Honorbuddy installation folder, create a new directory and name it "Meshes" (this is just an example. You can save and name it however you prefer)
2.Put all downloaded directories in your newly created directory (Example)
3.Start Honorbuddy and click "Settings & Tools" (Einstellungen & Extras in german)
4.In the opened "Settings & Tools" popup, you can find an option "Meshes", where you can define the path to your previously created Meshes directory (Example)

That's it! Now, you can start botting. Honorbuddy should use the downloaded meshfiles now.
